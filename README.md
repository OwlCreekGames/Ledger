**Ledger** is an Unreal Engine plugin for managing gameplay state. It provides a simple way to store key/value data organized into named domains. It supports common primitive types such as integers, floats, booleans, and strings. Domains can be defined for unrestricted storage or configured with a schema to enforce specific keys and value types.

> ⚠️ **This plugin is under active development.**
>
> **Ledger** is currently experimental and may be unstable. APIs, features, and file formats are subject to change as the system evolves.
